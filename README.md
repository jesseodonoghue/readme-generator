# README Generator
This Node.js app required me to create a CLI program that receives input from the user and generates a README for their GitHub project based on the answers. 

## App Breakdown
This command line interface program asks the user for the following information about their GitHub project: title, description, installation instructions, usage information, to select a license from a list of options, testing instructions, their GitHub username, and finally their email address. Using all of this information it dynamically generates a README.md file in the "generated" directory to be added to their GitHub project. Badges are shown to represent the license that they selected. The table of contents links to each section of the README and there are links back to the ToC contained in each section.

## Live Link
This program is not web-based, so there is no live version. Here is a link to a video of the program in action: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jf_59xess7G9uGafA21Hr3MxNyJvvMnc/view
